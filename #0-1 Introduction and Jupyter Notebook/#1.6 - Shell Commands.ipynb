    "As an example, here is a sample of a Linux/OSX shell session where a user explores, creates, and modifies directories and files on their system (``osx:~ $`` is the prompt, and everything after the ``$`` sign is the typed command; text that is preceded by a ``#`` is meant just as description, rather than something you would actually type in):\n",

    "Notice that all of this is just a compact way to do familiar operations (navigating a directory structure, creating a directory, moving a file, etc.) by typing commands rather than clicking icons and menus.\n",
    "Note that with just a few commands (``pwd``, ``ls``, ``cd``, ``mkdir``, and ``cp``) you can do many of the most common file operations.\n",
    "It's when you go beyond these basics that the shell approach becomes really powerful."

    "# Shell-Related Magic Commands\n",

    "```ipython\n",
    "In [11]: !pwd\n",
    "/home/root/projects/myproject\n",

    "\n",
    "In [13]: !pwd\n",
    "/home/root/projects/myproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason is that shell commands in the notebook are executed in a temporary subshell.\n",
    "If you'd like to change the working directory in a more enduring way, you can use the ``%cd`` magic command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [14]: %cd ..\n",
    "/home/root/projects\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, by default you can even use this without the ``%`` sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [15]: cd myproject\n",
    "/home/root/projects/myproject\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is known as an ``automagic`` function, and this behavior can be toggled with the ``%automagic`` magic function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides ``%cd``, other available shell-like magic functions are ``%cat``, ``%cp``, ``%env``, ``%ls``, ``%man``, ``%mkdir``, ``%more``, ``%mv``, ``%pwd``, ``%rm``, and ``%rmdir``, any of which can be used without the ``%`` sign if ``automagic`` is on.\n",
    "This makes it so that you can almost treat the Notebook prompt as if it's a normal shell:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",
    "In [16]: mkdir tmp\n",
    "\n",
    "In [17]: ls\n",
    "tmp/\n",
    "\n",
    "In [20]: rmdir tmp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This access to the shell from within the same terminal window as your Python session means that there is a lot less switching back and forth between interpreter and shell as you write your Python code."
